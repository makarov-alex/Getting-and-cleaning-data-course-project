#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
***

This repository contains course project for Cousera Getting and Cleaning Data course (part of Data Science specialization). <br/> 
The assignment was to create an R script, which prepares tidy data from raw dataset collected from sensors in Samsung Galaxy S smartphone by researchers from [Università degli Studi di Genova](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).<br/>
 Final script must execute following steps:<br/>
1. Merges training and test datasets <br/>
2. Extracts only mean and standard deviation data for each measurement<br/>
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br/>
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names<br/>
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
_(Detailed descriptions of operations, variables and assumptions could be found in **CodeBook.MD**)_<br/>
<br/>
There are 4 files:<br/>
1. **run_analysis.R** - R script files, which process data<br/>
2. **README.MD** - description of depository and files inside it<br/>
3. **CodeBook.MD** - detailed description of opeartions, variables and assumptions<br/>
4. **TidyData.txt** - tidy dataset, which is result of run_analysis.R execution<br/>

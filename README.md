#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
***

This repository contains course project for Cousera Getting and Cleaning Data course (part of Data Science specialization).  
The assignment was to create an R script, which prepares tidy data from raw dataset collected from sensors in Samsung Galaxy S smartphone by researchers from [Università degli Studi di Genova](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) Final script must execute following steps:
1. Merges training and test datasets 
2. Extracts only mean and standard deviation data for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
_(Detailed descriptions of operations, variables and assumptions could be found in **CodeBook.MD**)_

There are 4 files:
1. **run_analysis.R** - R script files, which 
2. **README.MD** - description of depository and files inside it
3. **CodeBook.MD** - detailed description of opeartions, variables and assumptions
4. **TidyData.txt** - tidy dataset, which is result of run_analysis.R execution
